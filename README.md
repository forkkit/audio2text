## About

After attending a couple of lectures I thought in recording them and then processing it into text, so I wrote this simple script that allows me to do that. It's not perfect, of course, but it's a proof of concept. I did the whole experiment in PT-BR, but you can try and change it to EN by altering the code on *main.js* to:

```javascript
/* insert your language code here */
recognition.lang = 'en-US';
```
